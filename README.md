# My Home Lab Project

![Network Diagram](./diagrams/network-diagram.png)

## Overview
This repository showcases my personal home lab project, a cloud-based cybersecurity learning environment hosted on AWS EC2 instances, managed locally with a local machine. It demonstrates my skills in network security, virtualization, and system administration. Key components include:
- Hardware: Local machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6-Core, 64.0 GB RAM, 932 GB storage.
- Software: Configured and managed AWS EC2 instances (Windows Server 2019, Ubuntu Server 22.04, and Amazon Linux 2023), implemented OpenVPN for secure access, and deployed Snort for intrusion detection.
- Networking: Designed VLAN segmentation via AWS VPC and enforced firewall rules using Security Groups.
