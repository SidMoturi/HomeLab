# VPC and Firewall Configurations

## Overview
Designed and implemented a secure AWS VPC as the foundation of my cloud-based cybersecurity lab, with comprehensive firewall settings to protect t2.micro instances running Windows Server 2019, Ubuntu Server 22.04, and Amazon Linux 2023.

## VPC Setup
- **VPC CIDR**: 10.0.0.0/16, serving as the core network.
- **Subnets**:
  - Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24 (Windows Server 2019).
  - Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24 (Ubuntu Server 22.04 with OpenVPN).
  - Subnet 3: 10.0.3.0/24 (Amazon Linux 2023 with Snort).
- **Internet Gateway**: Attached to the VPC for internet access, linked to the main route table.

## Firewall Configuration
- **Security Group Rules**:
  - **Inbound Rules**:
    - SSH: Port 22, Source: My local IP (e.g., 203.0.113.0/32).
    - Telnet: Port 23, Source: My local IP (for testing).
    - HTTP: Port 80, Source: 0.0.0.0/0.
    - HTTPS: Port 443, Source: 0.0.0.0/0.
    - OpenVPN: Port 1194, Source: My local IP.
  - **Outbound Rules**:
    - All traffic: 0.0.0.0/0, allowing instances to access the internet.
- **Routing Tables**:
  - Destination: 10.0.0.0/16, Target: Local.
  - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0, Target: Internet Gateway.

## Technical Achievements
- Designed a VPC with segmented subnets and an Internet Gateway for connectivity.
- Configured detailed Security Group rules for secure access and testing.
- Set up routing to ensure internet access across the network.
